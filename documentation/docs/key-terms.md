# Key terms 

H2O LLM Studio uses several key terms across its documentation, and each, in turn, is explained in the sections below.

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and effective input queries to guide language models in generating desired outputs or responses.

## Agents

Software entities or components that interact with data or perform tasks within a system.

## ELO

An algorithm or method used to assess and rank the performance or accuracy of language models based on their proficiency in understanding and processing textual data.

## Vector Store

A Vector Store stores numerical representations of text for fast access in language models.

## Pre-training 

The initial phase of training a machine learning model on a large dataset to learn general features before fine-tuning on a specific task.

## Attention

A mechanism that enables models to focus on specific parts of input data relevant to the task at hand, enhancing their understanding and performance.

## Embedding

Embedding refers to a mathematical representation of words or tokens in a numerical vector space, enabling machine learning models to understand and process language based on their context and relationships.

## Language Model

A language model is an AI system that understands and generates human language, predicting and generating text based on patterns and context within a given sequence of words.

## Transformer

A Transformer refers to a neural network architecture specifically designed for processing sequential data like text, using attention mechanisms to learn contextual relationships between words or tokens.

## Encoders and Decoders

Encoders and decoders are vital parts of sequence-to-sequence models used in natural language processing. Encoders process input data into a fixed-size representation, while decoders generate an output sequence based on that representation.

##  Text generation

Text generation is the process of creating written content, such as sentences or paragraphs, using machine learning or AI algorithms based on patterns learned from existing text data.
